With the click of a TV a popup will appear with a question, answer form, and a 15-second timer. Once your time has expired whatever you have typed in will automatically be submitted as your answer. So, if you were almost done answering the question there's a chance you will still be given credit.

The leaderboard is organized by number of correct answers and shows your best high score. Under Stats you can see your percentage of correct answers, single-game highscore, and total cash earned.
