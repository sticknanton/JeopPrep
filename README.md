A single-player Jeopardy Training program for those that desire to be among the stars of the show! Sign up and log in to become a part of the action. The game will track your money earned, questions answered and show you a leaderboard for how you stack up against the competition.

With the click of a TV a popup will appear with a question, answer form, and a 15-second timer. Once your time has expired whatever you have typed in will automatically be submitted as your answer. So, if you were almost done answering the question there's a chance you will still be given credit.

The leaderboard is organized by number of correct answers and shows your best high score. Under Stats you can see your percentage of correct answers, single-game highscore, and total cash earned.

Technologies used in this app are Node, Mongo, and Express. We also access a third-party-api to get few jokes on the page, and have a large JSON file to be able to access game data.
